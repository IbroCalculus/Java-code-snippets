Modules were introduced in Java in JDK 9.
The purpose is to solve the problems typically involved with developing and deploying java applications prior to Java 9.

A module is a name of collection of data and code.
Modules can contain Java code that is organized as a set of packages. Each package can contain classes, interfaces and so on.
You can think of a module as a container of packages.

Every module needs to have some configurations;
	- name: unique name of the module.
	- inputs: What the module needs to use and what is required for the module to be compiled and run.
	- outputs: What the module outputs or exports to other modules.

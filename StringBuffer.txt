CHECK ALSO; String Builder

NB: Difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer:
StringBuffer is thread-safe but slower, while StringBuilder is not thread-safe but faster.

thread-safe means multiple threads cannot utilize the same string buffer object simultaneously.

Because StringBuffer is thread-safe, this makes it a little slower compared to StringBuilder which is not thread-safe.


This is used to create mutable strings.

        StringBuffer fullName = new StringBuffer("Ibrahim");
        fullName.append(" Musa");
        System.out.println(fullName);
        System.out.println(fullName.length());

Some methods include;
length, insert, replace, reverse, delete. etc

CHECK Data Types

There are 3 type of variables;
1. Instance variables: <=== Declared globally without the static keyword
    ie int speed = 100;
2. Static variables:   <=== There are initialized only once at the start of the program execution. There should be initialized first before initializing any instance variable
    ie static int x = 10;
3. Local variables:    <=== Declared locally within a function
    ie void method(){
        int y = 50
}

Data types: String, int, float, char, boolean.

Declaration:

String name;
int number;
float another_number;
char value;
boolean state:

name = "My name";
number = 34;
another_number = 34.2345f;
value = 'A';
state = true;

Polymorphism is the greek word for poly-"many", morph-"form".
It is the ability of an object to identify as more than one type.

Assuming a class called Vehicle (Parent), and 3 other classes, Bicycle, Boat, Car.
To store the objects as an array;


public class Vehicle {
    public void go(){
        
    }
}


public class Car extends Vehicle{
    public void go(){
        System.out.println("The Car is going forward");
    }
}


public class Bicycle extends Vehicle{
    public void go(){
        System.out.println("The Bicycle is going forward");
    }
}


public class Boat extends Vehicle{
    public void go(){
        System.out.println("The Boat is going forward");
    }
}



--- in main method ---

public class SamPle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Boat boat = new Boat();
        Car car = new Car();
        Bicycle bicycle = new Bicycle();		

        Vehicle[] vehicles = {boat,car,bicycle};	//car object identifies as a Car as well as a vehicle, likewise the others.
	
        for (Vehicle x: vehicles){
            x.go();
        }


    }
}


==================	DYNAMIC POLYMORPHISM	==============================
It is polymorphism during runtime




===================== FROM ANOTHER LECTURE =================
========================== Polymorphism are of different kinds. (3) =======================
------------------- 1. Creating multiple constructor for same class. Constructor overloading.

------------------- 2. Two methods inside a parent and a child class, doing the same thing differently. ie Overriding a Parent class method in child class. 

------------------- 3. Creating multiple methods with the same name, but different parameter types and/or number of arguments. Method Overloading.

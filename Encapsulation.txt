Restricting accessing properties of a class to the outside world
Adds a layer of security

This is when attributes of a class will be hidden or private,
can be accessed only through methods (getters and setters)
You should make attributes private if you don't have a reason to make them public/protected.

Use generate getters and setters
Then, instance.get(), instance.set()

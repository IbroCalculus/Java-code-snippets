Maven (Apache Maven): Is a command line tool that helps programmers manage their projects and all the things they need to build their programs.
These includes; dependencies management, building and testing of projects, as well as packaging the projects.


==== RUNNING MAVEN =======
./mvnw clean compile

- ./mvnw: This is a Maven wrapper script. It is used to run Maven goals without having to install Maven separately on your system. The ./ indicates that the script is located in the current directory.
- Clean (clean): It removes the target directory and cleans the project.
- Compile (compile): It compiles the source code of the project.

=== MAVEN PHASES ===
Maven has 3 phases; ie clean, default and site. A phase is somewhat like a lifecycle,
* clean - Removes temporary directories and files
* default - Where the most useful goals live.		(A goal is something specific you aim to achieve, while a lifecyle is the order of those goals. A phase can contain one or more goals)
* site - Where documentation is generated

* clean - This contains:
	- pre-clean: Hook for before cleaning
	- clean: - Does the actual cleaning
	- post-clean: Hook for after cleaning 
> ./mvnw clean 


* default - This contains:
	- compile: Compiles your code into bytecode
	- test: Runs unit tests
	- package: Creates a jar or war file
	- verify: Runs checks and integration tests
> ./mvnw compile  



======== BUILDING A MAVEN PROJECT jar =========

 ./mvnw clean package
Then locate the generated jar file within 'target' directory (ie demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar): 
Then run the project via cmd: java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Then open in browser (ie localhost:8080//api/v1/student)

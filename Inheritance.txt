==============================
Inheritance is the process one class acquires the attributes and methods of another.
Java does not support multiple inheritance, except with the help of interfaces. CHECK Interfaces for this

Assuming main class to inherit from is Vehicles, Class to inherit from Vehicles class are Cars and Bicycles.
Vehicles class is the Super class also known as the parent class.
Cars and Bicycles classes sub classes of the vehicle class, aslo known as the child classes.

=== VEHICLES CLASS ===========

public class Vehicles {
    double speed;

    void go()
    {
        System.out.printf("This vehicle is moving");
    }

    void stop()
    {
        System.out.println("This vehicle has stopped moving");
    }

}

====== CARS CLASS and BICYCLES CLASS ============

public class Cars extends  Vehicles{
}

public class Bicycles extends Vehicles{

}


INSIDE MAIN CLASS

public class SamPle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Vehicles vehicles = new Vehicles();
        Bicycles bicycles = new Bicycles();
        Cars cars = new Cars();

        vehicles.go();
        bicycles.go();
        cars.go();

    }
}

OUTPUT:

	This vehicle is moving
	This vehicle is moving
	This vehicle is moving


================ OVERRIDE AN INHERITED METHOD (method overriding) ====================
e.g within the bicycle class

public class Bicycles extends Vehicles{

    @Override
    public void go(){
        System.out.printf("The bicycle is moving\n");
    }
}


=========== SUPER KEYWORD =============
Inherit constructor from parent class to child class

Assuming Parent class Person, and sub class Hero.

public class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    
    Person(String name, int age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}


public class Hero extends Person {
    String power;
    Hero(String name, int age, String power){
        super(name, age);
        this.power = power;
    }
}


public class SamPle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Ibrahim", 26);
        Hero hero = new Hero("Spiderman", 21, "Spider web");

    }
}
